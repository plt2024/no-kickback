Bribery in international business transactions can have significant impacts. 
For instance, multinational firms have often traded payoffs for favorable consideration by decision makers to win contracts, reduce import duties, or receive favorable interpretations of laws affecting the firm³. 
This practice can connect societies with very different customs and practices regarding bribery³. 
However, it's important to note that such practices are generally considered unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions, and they can lead to serious consequences for the firms involved.
